  (1, 'Sarah''s Library', 'Sarah loved to read books. Every Saturday, she went to the library with her mother. Sarah borrowed three books each time. She read stories about animals, adventures, and magic. Her favorite book was about a brave girl who traveled around the world. Sarah dreamed that one day she would travel too.', '300L', 1, 'routing'),
  (2, 'Why We Need Longer Lunch Breaks', 'Students should have longer lunch breaks at school. Currently, lunch is only 30 minutes long. This is not enough time to eat properly and relax. When students rush through lunch, they often feel tired in afternoon classes. A longer lunch break would allow students to eat slowly and digest their food properly. They could also have time to play outside or talk with friends. This would help them feel more energized for afternoon learning. Many successful schools already have longer lunch breaks.', '500L', 1, 'routing'),
  (3, 'Egyptian Pyramids', 'The Ancient Egyptians built pyramids as tombs for their pharaohs. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest and most famous pyramid. It was constructed around 2560 BCE and took approximately 20 years to complete. Workers moved more than 2 million stone blocks, each weighing about 2.5 tons. How the Egyptians transported and positioned these massive blocks remains a subject of debate among historians and archaeologists. The pyramids demonstrate the Egyptians'' advanced engineering skills and organizational abilities.', '600L', 1, 'routing'),
  (4, 'Alex''s Volunteer Work', 'During the summer vacation, Alex volunteered at a local animal shelter. He helped feed the dogs and cats, cleaned their living areas, and played with them. Alex noticed that many animals seemed lonely and needed attention. He decided to create posters to help them find homes. His efforts paid off when three dogs and two cats were adopted within a month. Alex felt satisfied knowing he had made a real difference in these animals'' lives.', '600L', 1, 'routing'),
  (5, 'The Case for Project-Based Learning', 'Schools should incorporate more project-based learning into their curriculum. Traditional teaching methods often focus on memorizing facts and taking tests. However, project-based learning engages students in solving real-world problems, which makes education more meaningful and memorable. This approach encourages critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity—skills essential for success in the 21st century. Studies have demonstrated that students in project-based programs show higher retention rates and develop stronger problem-solving abilities compared to those in traditional classrooms.', '700L', 1, 'routing'),
  (6, 'The Water Cycle', 'The water cycle is how water moves around Earth. First, the sun heats water in lakes and oceans. The water turns into vapor and goes up into the air. This is called evaporation. In the sky, the vapor cools and forms clouds. This is condensation. When clouds get heavy, rain falls down. This is precipitation. Rain fills lakes and oceans again.', '300L', 1, 'routing'),
  (7, 'The Importance of Honeybees', 'Honeybees are important insects that help plants grow. They fly from flower to flower collecting nectar. While visiting flowers, bees spread pollen, which helps plants make seeds and fruit. Without bees, many plants would not be able to reproduce. Bees also make honey from the nectar they collect. They store honey in their hives as food for the winter months.', '400L', 1, 'routing'),
  (8, 'Family Camping Trip', 'The Johnson family planned a camping trip for the weekend. They packed tents, sleeping bags, and food in their car. When they arrived at the campsite, everyone helped set up the tents. In the evening, they made a campfire and roasted marshmallows. That night, they looked at the stars and told stories.

  (10, 'The Benefits of Early Language Learning', 'Every student should learn a second language in elementary school. Research shows that young children learn languages more easily than adults because their brains are more flexible. Learning a second language improves cognitive skills, enhances problem-solving abilities, and strengthens memory. Additionally, in our increasingly globalized world, bilingual individuals have better career opportunities. By starting language education early, schools can help students develop valuable skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.', '600L', 1, 'routing'),
  (11, 'Maria''s Piano Journey', 'Maria had always wanted to learn how to play the piano. When she turned ten, her parents enrolled her in piano lessons. At first, playing the piano was difficult. Her fingers felt clumsy on the keys, and she struggled to read the music. However, Maria practiced every day after school. Gradually, she improved. Six months later, she performed her first piece at a recital. Her family was proud of her dedication and hard work.', '500L', 1, 'routing'),

While Earth''s climate has changed throughout history, current changes are occurring at an unprecedented rate.
